Twitter Unfavourite All
=======================

Use this script to unfavourite all of your favourites. 


### Caution - Use at your own risk. 

## Installation

You must have Python 2.7.x installed on your system and on the command line. 
On Linux this is easy enough, but if you are on windows I recommend [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

Once Python is installed the only other requirement is the [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy). Install with

    pip install tweepy

Finally download this repository by either clicking on the zip button on Github, or cloning the repository. 

## Running

Navigate to where you downloaded this repository and enter the project folder. Open "unfavorite.py" and enter
the required information for your account. You will need to register an app on Twitter. No worries, it is quick 
and painless. 

Once everything is setup run 

    python unfavourite.py 

All done!!
